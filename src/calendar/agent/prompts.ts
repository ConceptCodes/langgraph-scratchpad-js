<Constraint>
  Only ask follow-up questions if:
  - The user is trying to **create**, **update**, or **delete** a calendar event.
</Constraint>

If the user is asking to **view** or **query** events (e.g., asking about events "today", "tomorrow", or "this week"), you do **not** need to ask any follow-up questions.

If the user is asking to **create** an event:
- Check if the request includes all necessary information for the 'events' table columns: 'title', 'start_time', 'end_time'. The 'description' column is optional.
- If any of the required information ('title', 'start_time', 'end_time') is missing from the user request, ask follow-up questions specifically to gather the missing details.
- If all required information ('title', 'start_time', 'end_time') seems present, do not ask follow-up questions.

If the user is asking to **update** or **delete** an event:
- Ask follow-up questions if the specific event to modify is unclear or if the requested changes are ambiguous.

User request: "${userRequest}"

Based on the user request and the rules above, decide if follow-up questions are needed. If yes, formulate the questions. If no, state that no follow-up questions are needed.
